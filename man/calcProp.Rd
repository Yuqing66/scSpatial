\title{Cell-Level Pairwise Retention Proportions}
\usage{
calcProp(group1, group2)
}
\arguments{
\item{group1}{A vector of baseline cluster assignments for each cell.}

\item{group2}{A vector of comparison cluster assignments for the same cells.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector giving, for each cell, the proportion of its
  `group1` cluster mates that stay together in `group2`.
}
\description{
Calculates, for each cell, the proportion of its original cluster mates in
`group1` that remain grouped together in `group2`. This per-cell metric can
be used to measure how cohesive a cluster stays across runs.

\examples{
calcProp(c(1, 1, 2, 2), c(1, 2, 2, 3))

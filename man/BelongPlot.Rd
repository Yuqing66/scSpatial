\title{Plot Cross-Seed Cluster Membership Proportions}
\usage{
BelongPlot(group1, group2, name.1 = NULL, name.2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{group1}{A vector of baseline cluster assignments for each cell.}

\item{group2}{A vector of comparison cluster assignments for the same cells.}

\item{name.1}{Optional axis label describing `group1`.}

\item{name.2}{Optional axis label describing `group2`.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object that can be further customised or saved.
}
\description{
Visualises the proportion of cells that transition from the clusters in
`group1` to the clusters in `group2` as a tile heatmap, highlighting how
stable each cluster remains across two clustering runs.
}
\examples{
BelongPlot(c(1, 1, 2, 2), c(1, 2, 2, 3))

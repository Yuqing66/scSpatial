\title{Calculate Cluster-Level Consistency Scores}
\usage{
consistency(group1, group2)
}
\arguments{
\item{group1}{A vector of baseline cluster assignments for each cell.}

\item{group2}{A vector of comparison cluster assignments for the same cells.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of consistency scores for the clusters in
  `group1`.
}
\description{
Quantifies the stability of each cluster by comparing how often its cells
remain together when reclustered. Scores close to 1 indicate strong
agreement between the two cluster assignments.
}
\examples{
consistency(c(1, 1, 2, 2), c(1, 2, 2, 3))

\title{Average Cell Stability Across Seeds}
\usage{
calcCellScore(df.seeds, i.seed1, i.seed2s = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df.seeds}{A data frame where each column contains cluster assignments
for a seed and each row corresponds to a cell.}

\item{i.seed1}{The column name in `df.seeds` to use as the reference seed.}

\item{i.seed2s}{Optional vector of column names to compare against. Defaults
to all seeds except `i.seed1`.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of per-cell stability scores between 0 and 1.
}
\description{
Aggregates per-cell retention proportions across multiple clustering runs to
produce a stability score that summarises how reliably each cell stays with
its original cluster across seeds.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(seed0 = c(1, 1, 2, 2), seed1 = c(1, 2, 2, 3))
calcCellScore(df, i.seed1 = "seed0")
}

\title{Summarise Consistency Against a Reference Seed}
\usage{
calcSeedConsistency(
  df.seeds,
  reference_seed,
  compare_seeds = NULL,
  return_long = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df.seeds}{Data frame of cluster assignments with cells in rows and
seeds in columns.}

\item{reference_seed}{Column name used as the baseline clustering.}

\item{compare_seeds}{Optional vector of column names to compare against; by
default all non-reference seeds are used.}

\item{return_long}{Logical; if `TRUE`, a tidy data frame of scores is
provided in the `long` element of the returned list.}
}
\value{
A list containing the `scores` matrix (comparison seeds x clusters),
  the `reference_seed`, the `compare_seeds` used, and, when requested, a
  `long` data frame.
}
\description{
Computes pairwise consistency scores between a reference clustering seed and
selected comparison seeds. Optionally returns a long-format summary that is
ready for plotting.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(seed0 = c(1, 1, 2, 2), seed1 = c(1, 2, 2, 3))
calcSeedConsistency(df, reference_seed = "seed0", return_long = TRUE)
}
